        <title>Hello World!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to get back to blogging and documenting my current learning trends, I thought it was time to fire up a new blog. So it follows that the new site should be something that I can poke and play with programming and my learning, and I am firing it up under GitHub Pages with a Jekyll engine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will apologize in advance that his will end up being down as much as up as I learn to adapt, customize it, and slowly write posts about things I am working on and learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up will be a wrap up on Cisco Live 2015, and all that transpired from my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
