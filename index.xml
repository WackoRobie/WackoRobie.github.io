      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to get back to blogging and documenting my current learning trends, I thought it was time to fire up a new blog. So it follows that the new site should be something that I can poke and play with programming while building as that is my latest distraction/hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the decision was to start with something simple like Hugo hosted on Github Pages. Allows me to work more with Git, YAML, and Go. While not spending much time stressing on the hosting platform. As I work toward more development with Python, I might start looking at alternatives like Django as it is in Python and helps with database frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you intend on following along I would expect to find the site broken as often as not, but will do my best to keep it up and working.&lt;/p&gt;
